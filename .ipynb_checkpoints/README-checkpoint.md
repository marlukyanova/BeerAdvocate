In this project, I analyzed user's reviews from BeerAdvocate (https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate) to find the best beers to recommend. To make my recommendations, I'll try to find out:
1. Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?
2. Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palate) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?
3. What can we say about reviewers?
4. If you had to pick up only 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
    
Using the data, I analazed factors that correlated with overall impression, and did some exploratory visualization and analysis. You can see the exploratory data analysis in the 'DataExploration.ipynb' notebook above.
